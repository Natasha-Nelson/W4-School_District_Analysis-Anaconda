# W4-School_District_Analysis-Anaconda

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to explore key metrics in school performance data in math and reading. Throughout this analysis, we look at the overall district performance, the performance of 15 high schools and other frameworks. In our initial phases, we assume that the scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School show evidence of academic dishonesty and should be dropped from the data set. In this analysis, we look at how school performance in terms of passing reading and/or math (scores >=70) is impacted by removing the scores of Thomas High School students in 9th grade. In addition to looking at overall district and school performance, we also examine grade averages at each school, performace by school type and school size.
